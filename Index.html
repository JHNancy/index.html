	<h1>Assignment 1 - Semester Project</h1>
	<p>By Jiayi He</p>
	<h2>Three Things What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I learned that critical web design, a term coined by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, is a design theory approach focused on challenging assumptions and exploring social issues through speculative and applied digital work.
		The former emphasizes practicality, while the latter is a more conceptual, critical approach to design.</li>
	<li>In the article "Evolution of the Web," I learned about the evolution of the web through its various eras, from the first to the third. Web 1.0 was simply called the web, but pages were static and lacked interactivity. 
		Web 2.0 websites became more dynamic, allowing users to interact with them. Web 3.0 features a centralized internet where users have greater control over their data and interactions.</li>
	<li>In the article "The Wax and Wane of the Web," I learned that social media platforms are constantly disintegrating and declining in the website, often prioritizing profit over privacy and user experience. 
		This has led to a growing interest in owning their own content again, with greater control, creativity, and autonomy over the content they create. 
		I also learned from the article that the evolution and rise and fall of the web should make us more reflective of our personal power in web</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Part 2-My Semester Project</h2>
	<p>For my semester, I hope I can Learn more code skills and know how to design websites better and faster first. (I have absolutely no experience in this area, and I used to think I am hard to using computers.) 
		And In my semester project, the primary idea that I want to do is create a website about myself. The content of the website will be about my hobbies, skills and my life.</p>
