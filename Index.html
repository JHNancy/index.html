	<h2>Three Things What I Learned</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the article "Evolution of the Web," I learned about the evolution of the web through its various eras, from the first to the third. Web 1.0 was simply called the web, but pages were static and lacked interactivity. Web 2.0 websites became more dynamic, allowing users to interact with them. Web 3.0 features a centralized internet where users have greater control over their data and interactions.</li>
